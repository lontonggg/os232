An intresting article that gives a great explanation about file systems in operating system.
    
## Week 04

[Pointers and Arrays in Linux C Programming](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-c-programming-tutorial-part-19-pointers-and-arrays/#:~:text=Pointers%20are%20a%20special%20kind,store%20an%20address%20into%20it.)

This article gives an excellent tutorial about pointers and arrays in Linux C programming.
   
## Week 05

[What Is Virtual Memory and How Does It Work?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/virtual-memory)

A great article that explains the concept and functioning of virtual memory, outlines two methods of managing virtual memory (paging and segmenting), and highlights the advantages and limitations of using virtual memory in modern computers.
    
[Memory Allocation Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10vroQb5IdY)

This video explains various memory allocation algorithms used in operating systems, including First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, Buddy System, and Next Fit. It provides animated demonstrations and examples to help me understand how each algorithm works.

[Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)

This article discusses the concept of paging in operating systems as a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It explains how paging divides both the logical address space and physical address space into fixed-size blocks or pages, allowing for efficient memory allocation, reduced internal fragmentation, and the protection and sharing of memory between processes.

## Week 06

[The Various Types of Concurrency in Operating Systems](https://lemp.io/the-various-types-of-concurrency-in-operating-systems/)
   
This article explains the importance of concurrency in operating systems, detailing how it enables multiple tasks to run simultaneously, improving performance. It covers various aspects, including types of concurrency, challenges, and real-world examples like elevator systems. Additionally, it discusses concurrency in programming, concurrent database operations, and principles for effective implementation in operating systems, emphasizing its crucial role in enhancing efficiency and system responsiveness.

[Fork System Call in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call-in-operating-system/)

This article explains the importance of the fork system call for creating new processes in operating systems by duplicating existing ones. It details key terminologies, benefits, and drawbacks of the fork system call, focusing on multitasking, memory optimization, and system stability. Overall, the article dives into the technical aspects of the fork system call, highlighting its role in managing processes, optimizing resources, and addressing potential challenges in operating systems.

[Difference Between Fork and Exec System Call](https://binaryterms.com/difference-between-fork-and-exec-system-call.html)

This article delineates the differences between the fork and exec system calls, highlighting how fork creates a new duplicate process while exec replaces the invoking process with a new one specified in its parameter. Fork generates a child process that executes simultaneously with its parent, whereas exec initiates a new process, replacing the current one entirely.
